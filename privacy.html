		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Using Your Personal Content</h2>
	<p>When using the extension, some of your personal content will be used by the extension to perform basic functions!</p>
	<p>These contents are only used on the client-side. The extension does not have a separate backend server. The extension can even completely disable all network permissions for offline use, so it will not collect any of your personal data.</p>
	<h3>Rules of Content Usage</h3>
	<h4>Browsing Page Content</h4>
	<p>When using the extension, the extension will use your browsing page content for the following purposes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Classify identification according to rules you set</li>
		<li>Expand hidden content according to rules</li>
		<li>Hide or remove content you do not want to see according to rules</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Cookie</h4>
	<p>When using the extension, the extension will use Cookies for the following purposes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Assist in identifying tweet content</li>
		<li>Hide tweet replies</li>
		<li>Hide users</li>
		<li>Block users</li>
		<li>Unblock users</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Cookies are only used locally. The extension itself does not have the function to share or collect Cookies. Even when used locally, Cookies are managed and protected by the browser or operating system.</p>
	<h4>Github (Optional)</h4>
	<p>When using the extension, you can optionally use GitHub, and the extension will use GitHub for the following purposes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Backup note information</li>
		<li>Backup interception rule settings</li>
		<li>Backup blacklists, whitelists</li>
		<li>Share and exchange lists or settings with other users</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The above purposes are based on your explicit settings. The extension itself will not automatically backup or share any data unless you explicitly set it!</p>
	<p>If you choose to use GitHub, you should be aware of GitHub's privacy policy and related security recommendations!</p>
	<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
	<h3>Security of Your Personal Data</h3>
	<p>The extension itself does not collect personal data. Since the extension does not have a dedicated backend server, it does not have the ability to collect personal data, and can even be used completely offline.</p>
	<p>The extension does not use third-party services or components, so there are no concerns about third-party services or components leaking personal data.</p>
	<p>However, please remember that browsers need the internet to function. As long as the internet is used, absolute security cannot be guaranteed. We can only ensure that the extension itself only uses your content locally, and the extension itself will not collect or send any of your personal data!</p>
	<h3>Links to Other Websites</h3>
	<p>Our service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third-party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.</p>
	<p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>
	<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
	<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
	<p>We will also update the "Last Updated" date of this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<p>We advise you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
